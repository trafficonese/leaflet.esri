# Project needs a new home.

Thank you all of you who have used this package and have contributed code/bugs/enhancements over the years. As you may have noticed I haven't been able to make any contributions to this project and others in the last two years. I was hoping to get back to developing/maintaining this package on a regular basis but my current work-life balance does not allow it and I don't see that situation changing anytime soon. 

So here is my humble request to the R geospatial community, if anyone wants to take over this project and maintain/develop it for the greater good, I will be more than happy to transfer the project over to your repo. Send me an email at bhaskarvk AT <google's mail domain>. Same offer holds of any of my other R packages that you might be interested in taking over.

**Please note that the javascripts being used in the current version are all almost 2 years old and counting and contain various security vulnerabilities. So I don't recommend anyone use this package anymore unless it is taken over and brought up to date by someone else. Until that happens please consider this project as abandonware.**

ESRI Leaflet bindings.
----------------------

ESRI bindings for the [leaflet](https://www.github.com/rstudio/leaflet) package, based on the [ESRI leaflet plugin](https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/). This package is part of the leaflet ecosystem of R packages for web mapping.

**Compatibility Matrix**

As of Feb, 2017 the leaflet R package is based on version 0.7.7 of the Leaflet Javascript library and therefore the leaflet.esri package is based on version 1.0.4 of esri-leaflet Jaascript library which is the last release compatible with the 0.7.x branch of Leaflet JS. The chart below shows more details.
